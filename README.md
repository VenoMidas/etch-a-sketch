# etch-a-sketch

Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
    Create the divs using JS.
    Put divs inside another "container" div
    Options for grid: float/clear, inline-block, flexbox, css grid.
    Hint - be mindful of borders and margins, they can effect size of squares

Set up a "hover" effect so that the divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a pixelated trail through your grid like a pen would. 
    Hover can have event listener for entering and/or exiting a div with the mouse.

Add a button to the screen that prompts the user asking for number of squares per side for the new grid.
    The new grid should replace the old grid and be in the same total space, ex 960px
    Set use input maximum 100?
    you should be able to enter, ex, 64 and have a 64x64 grid popup without changing the amount of pixels used.

Optional - Instead of changing the color of the square from black to white try random RGB colors
    or try each pass add another 10% black so after 10 passes it is completely black.
